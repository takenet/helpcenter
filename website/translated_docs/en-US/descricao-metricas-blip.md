The BLiP Analytics module displays information based on the events that happened in a bot. These events are categorized in three dimensions:

* Messages
* Users
* Custom events

The **Dashboard** report, found in the Analytics module, has charts (or metrics) related only to the Users and Messages dimensions. However, you are free to create custom reports that use any of the three available dimensions.

Below you will find a description for each of the different metrics shown in the **Dashboard** report:

## 1. Active users

Represents the number of **unique users** that **sent or received** at least one message from the bot in the specified period.

## 2. Engaged users

Represents the number of **unique users** that talked (**sent at least one message**) to the bot in the specified period.

## 3. Active users per day

The number of unique users that sent at least one message, per day, to the bot in the specified period.

## 4. Exchanged messages

Total number of messages that were sent and received by the bot in the specified period.

## 5. Sent messages

Total number of messages sent by the bot in the specified period.

## 6. Received messages

Total number of messages received by the bot in the specified period.

## 7. Messages per day

The number of messages that were sent and received, per day, by the bot on the specified period.

## 8. Active messages

Every message sent from the bot to a client 24 hours after the last sent message from the same client to the bot are defined as active messages. **These messages are classified differently for being subject to charging and usage policies specific to each channel.**
