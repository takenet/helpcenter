BLiP uses distinct names for each of its different message subcategories. This article describes each one of the existing types of messages used in the platform. **Note that in all of the following cases, the point of reference is always the bot.**

## Exchanged messages
Total number of messages sent or received by the bot to the users in a given period.

## Received messages
Messages received by the bot from the users in a given period.

## Sent messages
Messages sent by the bot to the users in a given period. Sent messages can be further classified as active or reply type messages.

## Active messages
Messages that were sent by the bot **24 hours after** having received a message from the client. Active messages require following specific rules per channel and may incur additional charges.

## Reply messages
São as mensagens enviadas pelo bot, em até 24 horas, após o recebimento de uma mensagem do cliente. Em geral, todas as mensagens definidas nos blocos de conteúdo do Builder são mensagens de resposta.
